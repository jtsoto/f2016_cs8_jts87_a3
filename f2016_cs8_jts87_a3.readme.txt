I did not think this assignment would be possible when I first read it. Complete confusion was
running through my head. But after many Google searches and some help from other programmers(outside of
the class), I slowly but surely pieced together code that outputs what I hope is correct. Like always the
heart of the code lies in the function. I had to define my functions before going into any actually work.
Then I took the extensive advice of using for loops and used them to my advantage. I even took the time to
beautify it!
